## Datsy Front-End [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RyanMG/front-end.png?branch=newUI)](https://travis-ci.org/RyanMG/front-end)
=============

Datsy is a free, open and simple means to access and explore an ever growing
number of data sets. This respository is for the client facing components, allowing users to access the data that is served via the Datsy API endpoints

The front end is built on Backbone.js, with a Node.js / Express server back end. Server side templates are built in Jade, and client side templating uses Handlebars. CSS is preprocessed by Stylus, and JS is written in CoffeeScript. Data visualizations are handled by D3.
